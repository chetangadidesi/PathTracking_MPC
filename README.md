# PathTracking_MPC
This repository implements a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based lateral and longitudinal tracking system for autonomous vehicles using a bicycle kinematic model. The system tracks reference trajectories generated via cubic spline interpolation, enabling smooth and accurate navigation even through switchbacks and sharp turns.
